Russian card game at 21. The game is very similar to Black Jack,
but slightly different. 

* The game allows you to compete with your friends online or with random people.
For fun, a game currency has been added, which has nothing to do with real money.
* The user can customize and create his own game room or join an existing one.
* The user has the opportunity to view his profile and statistics, as well as visit
the profiles of other users, add them as friends and communicate.
* The leaderboard allows you to see the strongest or luckiest players and see ratings
for various parameters. 
* In the settings you can configure your avatar and privacy
and make other changes.

The project is far from finished. I do it whenever I have free time.
